## Overview
This is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in Java. The system runs from the command line where a user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range and number of attempts.

## Project Structure
- `src/` : Contains all Java source files.
- `Main.java` : The main entry point to run the game.
- Other `.java` files implement the core game logic, input handling, and utility functions.

## Setup & Running the Game
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the source directory:
cd NumberGuessingSystem/src

text
3. Compile all Java source files:
javac *.java

4. Run the game:
java Main

## How to Play
- The program will generate a random number.
- You will be prompted to enter your guess.
- The game provides feedback if your guess is too high or too low.
- Keep guessing until you find the correct number or run out of attempts.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or above recommended).
- Command line or terminal with Java environment set up.

## Notes
- Adjust the number range and maximum attempts inside the source code if needed.
- Make sure all `.java` files are in the `src` directory when compiling.
